        <h1>Flock Simluation</h1>
        <p>
            This simluation is based off of the fascinating paper 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/">
            <i>Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model</i></a> by Creig 
            Reynolds. I highly recommend reading it. This site goes over the main points of 
            the paper and provides interactive simulations to help you visualize the 
            behaviors that lead to flocking.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Craig Reynolds says, the motion of a flock of birds or a school of fish is 
            a beautiful part of the natural world. I can recall many instances of being 
            fascinated by the sight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is it possible to simulate this motion using computer graphics? At first, the 
            task seems daunting. One possible method is to create a script for each bird 
            to follow. For example, you could take one bird and say "move straight for 10 
            frames, then turn 30 degrees clockwise over the next 10 frames, then move 
            straight for another 15 before turning the other direction" and so on. This 
            would work, but there are many problems with this approach. First of all, most 
            flocks consist of thousands of birds. Scripting out a path for every single 
            bird will quickly become very tedious and unmaintainable, especially if you 
            wanted to match the complexity and fluidity of a real flock. Second, it would 
            be very difficult to make changes to the path of any bird. The path of a bird 
            is usually dependent on its neighbors, and the paths of its neighbors are
            usually dependent on it. Also, any change to a bird's path will greatly affect 
            the future path of that bird. Finally, the script will eventually come to an 
            end. I guess the programmer could put the script in a loop, but that would 
            require that each bird starts and ends in a location that is the same relative 
            to every other bird.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, there is an easier way. Think of a real life bird flying in the
            middle of a flock. How does it decide in which direction to go? In reality
            there may be hundreds of things that the bird must consider. However, for our
            simple simulation, each bird in a flock relies solely on its perception of
            the other birds in its immediate vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have a look at the simulation below. In it, there are many boids (a term coined
            by Mr. Reynolds combining "bird" and "droid") that are programmed with only one 
            behavior: move forward at a certain speed. Initially, Each boid is given a random 
            position and velocity vector, and the position of the boid in the next frame is 
            calculated by adding the velocity vector to the position vector (the velocity does 
            not change). Of course this does not yet look like a flock, but it is a good 
            starting point. There are three behaviors that each boid must take into account 
            each time it decides its next move. These behaviors are Separation, Alignment, and 
            Cohesion. Alongside these three main behaviors are other important considerations, 
            such as the perception radius of each boid and the magnitude of the forces applied
            by each of the main behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The count input affects the number of boids in the simulation, and the max speed 
            input puts a limit on the magnitude of the veloicities of each boid.

        <h2>Separation</h2>
        <img src="separation.gif" alt="Boid Separation Behavior">
        <p>
            The first flocking behavior we will look at is Separation, or the desire for a boid 
            to steer away from other boids that are too close. In real life, a bird in a flock 
            will normally try to keep some minimum distance between itself and the birds around 
            it so as to not risk a collision. In this simulation, a boid can only sense and react 
            to other boids that are within its perception radius. A boid is too close to another 
            boid if the distance between them is less than half their perception radius. When a 
            boid determines that another boid is too close, it starts to accelerate in the opposite
            direction. The amount of separation is proportional to the inverse of the distance. 
            In other words, the separation force is stronger the closer the boids are to each
            other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following simulation shows the separation behavior. This probably looks even less
            like a flock than the first simulation and you may be wondering why it is even one of
            the main behaviors. Once we talk about the other behaviors, and especially cohesion,
            it will hopefully start to make sense. You may notice that the boids in this simulation 
            all start to slow down after a little while. This generally occurs when two boids are 
            coming at each other head on. The separation force causes each to accelerate away from
            each other and in the opposite direction of their current heading. This is a negative
            acceleration which decreases their velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The perception radius input affects the perception radius of each boid. With a small 
            perception radius, boids can only see and react to boids that are very close to them.
            The separation input affects the force of separation. The larger the separation force,
            the larger the acceleration that is applied to each boid when they are trying to 
            separate.

        <p>
            The next behavior we will look at is alignment. This is probably the most important
            of the three main behaviors. Alignment is the desire for a bird to steer in the same 
            direction as its neighbors. In other words, each boid will try to match the velocities
            of the boids around it. This behavior really helps with separation, since it is easier 
            for boids to avoid collisions if they are heading in the same direction.
